            Most of Cave Research Foundation's work is conducted through five
            different operations areas which operate primarily on state and
            federal lands that contain caves and karst. <br /><br />
            Projects are done under a nationwide Memorandum of Understanding
            with the U.S. Department of the Interior, a Memorandum of Agreement
            with Bureau of Land Management, or through local working agreements
            depending on the requirements of each area. There are multiple
            Operations Areas that focus on different areas of the country and
            they are listed below.

                    uses a portable simulated cave to provide school-age kids
                    with an immersive "caving" experience that teaches them
                    about caves and cave science in a fun, hands-on way.
