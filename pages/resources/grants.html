                <h2 class="h2" id="container-h2">Deadline: March 1, 2025</h2>
                <p class="p" id="container-one-p">In 2015, the Cave Research Foundation (CRF) named its graduate research grant program after Philip M. Smith, CRF’s founding president (1957-1965). 
                    A Springfield, Ohio native and Ohio State University graduate in geology and science education, Smith (1932-2014) 
                    was a leader in science, technology, and public policy for over 50 years. He contributed to polar research programs
                    with the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, and National Science Foundation and advised 
                    Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter on science policy. In the 1950s-60s, Smith was active in caving, 
                    co-founding the Central Ohio Grotto of the National Speleological Society and joining the NSS C3 
                    expedition in Floyd Collins Crystal Cave, Kentucky. At a time when few American scientists studied caves, the C3 expedition 
                    highlighted the need for sustained exploration. CRF was founded to support such research, inspired partly by Smith’s work on the International Geophysical Year. 
                    From its start, CRF has prioritized multidisciplinary research. Honoring Smith’s legacy, CRF offers 
                    grants for master's and doctoral research in cave and karst studies across earth, natural, and social sciences. 
                    The CRF Board of Directors sets the funding cap annually, typically awarding four to six grants of $1,000 to $3,000.

                <h1 class="h1" id="container-h1">Application Guidelines</h1>
                <p class="p">Deadline: March 1 (annually)
                    Submission: Email a single PDF (preferred) or DOCX/RTF file to Dr. Patricia Kambesis (pat.kambesis@wku.edu) and Dr. Kayla Sapkota (knsapkota@asub.edu). Paper copies are not accepted.
                    Applicants must be enrolled in a degree-granting institution, with preference for thesis or dissertation projects. U.S. and international students may apply, 
                    but submissions must be in English.
                    <ul id="container-ul">
                        Required Materials:
                        <li>Title & Abstract – A title page with a ≤250-word abstract for a non-specialist audience. Include your department, major advisor, and degree level (master’s or doctoral).</li>
                        <li>Research Proposal – A ≤10-page, single-spaced proposal (12 pt. font, 1-inch margins), including tables/figures (references excluded from the limit). <br>
                            Cover the research problem, background, significance (especially to cave and karst studies), and methods.</li>
                        <li>Budget & Schedule – Detail research funding needs and indicate other funding sources or grant applications.</li>
                        <li>Curriculum Vitae (CV) – List publications, conference presentations, honors, and relevant research qualifications.</li>
                        <li>Letters of Reference – Two letters, including one from your graduate advisor or committee chair. Referees may send letters directly to the grant program chairs.</li>
                        <li>Review Process: Proposals are evaluated by a panel of karst scientists (e.g., geologists, biologists, hydrologists, archaeologists). Research with broad significance to cave and karst studies is more likely to receive funding.</li>
                        <li>Pre-Submission Inquiry: Applicants are encouraged to contact the grant committee chairs before submitting a full proposal to discuss project suitability.</li>
